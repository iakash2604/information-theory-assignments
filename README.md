## assignment - 1: Joint typicality based decoding 
1. Simulated a BSC. 
2. Transmited data over the BSC using joint typicality based compression and decoding

## assignment - 2: polar coding
1. Polar coding over a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) is studied. 
2. maximum likelihood based successive cancellation decoder is implemented.
